# Brewfile Example
# This demonstrates the difference between tap, brew, and cask

# ============================================================================
# TAP: Additional repositories/formulas for Homebrew
# Think of taps as "package sources" - they add new repositories where
# Homebrew can find formulas and casks that aren't in the default tap
# ============================================================================
tap "homebrew/cask"                    # macOS applications (usually auto-added)
tap "homebrew/cask-fonts"              # Font packages
tap "homebrew/cask-versions"          # Alternative versions of apps
tap "homebrew/services"                # Services management
tap "railwaycat/emacsmacport"         # Example: third-party tap for Emacs

# ============================================================================
# BREW: Command-line tools and libraries
# These are traditional Homebrew packages - CLI tools, libraries, compilers, etc.
# Installed to /opt/homebrew (Apple Silicon) or /usr/local (Intel)
# ============================================================================
brew "git"                             # Version control
brew "node"                            # Node.js runtime
brew "python@3.11"                     # Python with specific version
brew "zsh"                             # Shell
brew "wget"                            # File downloader
brew "curl"                            # HTTP client
brew "jq"                              # JSON processor
brew "fzf"                             # Fuzzy finder
brew "ripgrep"                         # Fast text search
brew "tmux"                            # Terminal multiplexer
brew "vim"                             # Text editor
brew "tree"                            # Directory tree viewer

# ============================================================================
# CASK: macOS Applications (.app bundles)
# These are GUI applications that get installed to /Applications
# ============================================================================
cask "google-chrome"                   # Web browser
cask "visual-studio-code"              # Code editor
cask "spotify"                         # Music streaming
cask "slack"                           # Team communication
cask "docker"                          # Container platform
cask "iterm2"                          # Terminal emulator
cask "rectangle"                       # Window manager
cask "1password"                       # Password manager

# ============================================================================
# CASK with FONTS: Fonts installed via Homebrew
# Fonts are a special type of cask
# ============================================================================
cask "font-fira-code"                  # Programming font
cask "font-jetbrains-mono"             # Another programming font
cask "font-source-code-pro"            # Adobe's monospace font

# ============================================================================
# MAS: Mac App Store applications (optional, requires mas-cli)
# Install mas first: brew install mas
# ============================================================================
# mas "Xcode", id: 497799835           # Example: Xcode from App Store
